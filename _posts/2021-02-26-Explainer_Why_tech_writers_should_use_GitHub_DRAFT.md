<!-- # Why should technical writers use GitHub to host their portfolio? -->

Technical writers, specifically those in developer documentation, can benefit from hosting their portfolio on GitHub for a variety of reasons. 

If you're not familiar with GitHub, it's a version control software used primarily by the software developer community. With GitHub, users create a repository to store project files in a central location. By single sourcing content, multiple people can collaborate on a project simultaneously and integrate their contributions seamlessly. 

<!-- which, when developming a new software with many features, github is invaluable -->

## Establish your presence in the developer community

Because GitHub is ubiquitous to the software developer community, it makes sense to introduce yourself on the platform. The best way to do this is by creating a GitHub profile. Once you create a GitHub profile, it's accessible to everyone.

Your GitHub profile contains a bio, a showcase of your favorite projects, a heatmap of your contribution activity, and a record of your most recent updates on the platform. You can also include external links to your portfolio site or social media. 

A GitHub portfolio is a dynamic portfolio. It's not just a collection of standalone documents. Instead, it shows how you're actively engaging in the community. It's an opportunity to share what projects you've accomplished and what you'd like to work on next.

<!-- increase your visibility, extend your reach -->

## Find and collaborate on open source projects
GitHub is a community of open source projects. If you want to grow your portfolio or gain experience, it's easy to find new projects to work on. Use search tags to filter results to your particular skillset. Or, challenge yourself and gain experience in something new. You can search for specific project topics or explore something new. GitHub can track all the projects you contribute to, making it easier to see your active presence in the technical writing sphere of GitHub.

## Demonstrate the "Docs as Code" workflow
The Docs as Code workflow is a philosophy that says technical writers should treat documentation the same way that developers treat code. In other words, technical writers can adopt the same tools and workflow that developers use. This makes it easier to integrate documentation into a software project because you are using tools and processes that developers are already familiar with.

- Tools

    Developer documentation is mostly written in lightweight markup languages, such as Markdown. With a technical writing portfolio, you want to be able to share not only the rendered output, but also the source files. With Markdown, you have a "one-size-fits-all" source code that can be rendered on any static site. 

- Workflow 

    Using GitHub will give you the chance to get comfortable with git commands.
    Git version control workflow. Clone a repo, git pull, git add, commit, push
    git checkout -b documentation
    Write documentation on a separate branch, then seamlessly integrate it into the production branch. Makes it easier to coordinate new features and their documentation.
    Use GitHub.com or learn git commands

By hosting a portfolio on GitHub, you can share, learn, and interact with the developer community.
