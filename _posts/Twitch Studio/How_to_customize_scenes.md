This tutorial covers how to edit and create new scenes in Twitch Studio.

## Edit an existing scene

From the home screen, click Edit Scene to switch to the editor view.


Insert graphic labelling UI components 

<!-- The scene will be displayed in the center preview window.  -->

<!-- Verify the current scene in the Scene Name panel on the right.  -->

<!-- The scene name is indicated in the center preview window, the Scene Name panel on the right, and as a heading in the left panel. 

Below the scene name, the left panel and below it a Layers subheading and a list of layers in the selected scene.

Below the left panel heading, you will see a Layers subheading and a list of layers.

Scene name and below that, a list of layers in that scene. 

This list represents all the layers on the selected scene.  -->

In the left panel, you'll see the scene name and a list of layers in that scene. 

Click the dropdown arrow next to the scene name to reveal all scenes. Select another scene to view its corresponding Layers list.

<!-- Note: The scene name is also identified in the center preview window and in the Scene Name panel to the right. -->

Click on a layer name to highlight it in the preview window and to open a customization palette.

Note: Different customization tools will be available based on the layer type. 

<!-- See Reference doc for an overview of the layer types and other UI components. -->

Drag a layer up and down the Layers list to change its order. Layers at the top of the list will display "on top" of layers further down the list.

Troubleshooting: If you don't see your Webcam layer in the preview window, it might be "under" the Wallpaper layer. Bring the layer forward by dragging it to the top of the Layers list.

<!-- Keep this in mind if a layer does not appear to show up in the preview window. It might be underneath another layer.  -->

If you want to add a new layer, click the plus icon next to the Layers heading.

In the new dialog window, select the type of layer you want and click Add. Customize the layer and save your changes.

Note: Create an Image layer to access Twitch branded assets including wallpapers, patterns, etc. 

<!-- Each object in the scene occupies a different layer.

Here, you can add, modify, or delete layers. -->

<!-- Click the dropdown arrow next to the Scene Name to reveal all scenes. Select another scene to start editing or click the plus icon to create a new scene. -->

## Create a new scene

There are two ways to create a new scene. 

Option 1: From home

In the Scenes panel, view a list of scenes. Click the plus icon at the bottom of the list to add a new scene.

Continue to add and customize layers. Click Save to save your new scene and return to the main screen.
