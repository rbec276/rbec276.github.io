## What features does Twitch Studio offer?

### Different levels of customization

The best feature of Twitch Studio is it's REWORDrobustREWORD media library. This is a database of images, wallpapers, and patterns that you can use to customize your stream. 

There are basically three levels of customization that you can choose. With Twitch Studio, you can choose how much effort you want to put into setting up your live stream. 

Level 1 Low effort: The first time you launch the app, you'll be prompted by a setup assistant. Twitch Studio generates three scenes with custom graphics for you to use. Each scene has a default template. For example, the Main scene has a gameplay screen, webcam capture, and alerts banner. You can tweak the scene graphics (wallpaper, image, pattern) at this point and be done with it.

Level 2 Medium effort: Once you reach the app, you can continue to edit your scenes as in Level 1, but this time you also have more customization features. For example, you now have access to a Layers palette, where you can change the type of media that shows up in your scenes. You might add a countdown timer to your Be Right Back scene, or modify the alert types on your Main scene. 

Level 3 HIgh effort: The top level of customization is to import your own media in the form of gifs, wallpapers, images, etc. For those that want to invest the time and effort to truly personalize their stream, the option is there.

Basically, Twitch Studio makes it easy to customize your stream as much--or as little--as you want. You can set up a great looking stream in a few minutes, or a few hours. The choice is up to you.
