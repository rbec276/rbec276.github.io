<!-- # Why should technical writers use GitHub to host their portfolio? -->

Technical writers, specifically those in developer documentation, can benefit from hosting their work portfolios on GitHub for a variety of reasons. 

If you're not familiar with GitHub, it's a version control software. 

With GitHub, users can create a repository to store project files. By single sourcing content, multiple people can work on the project simultaneously and integrate their contributions seamlessly. For more information on GitHub, take GitHub's [free introduction course](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github).


## Establish your presence in the developer community

Because GitHub is ubiquitous to the software development community, it makes sense to introduce yourself on the platform by creating a GitHub profile.

Your GitHub profile contains a bio, a showcase of your favorite projects, a heatmap of your contribution activity, and a record of your most recent updates. You can even include external links to your writing blog or social media. 

Once you create a GitHub profile, it's accessible to everyone. 

A GitHub portfolio is a dynamic portfolio. It's not just a collection of standalone documents. Instead, it shows how you are actively engaging in the community. It's an opportunity to share what projects you've accomplished and what you'd like to work on next.

## Find and collaborate on open source projects
GitHub is a community of open source projects. If you want to grow your portfolio or gain experience, it's easy to look for new projects to work on. Use search tags to filter results to your particular technical writing skills. Or, challenge yourself and gain experience in something new. You can search for specific project topics or explore something new. You can use search tags to filter your results. You can contribute to projects that interest or challenge you. GitHub can track all the projects you contribute to, making it easier to see your active presence/footprint in the tech writing/dev documentation field. 



## Demonstrate the "Docs as Code" workflow
The Docs as Code workflow is a philosophy that says technical writers should treat documentation the same way that developers treat code. In other words, technical writers can adopt the same tools and workflow that developers use. This makes it easier to integrate documentation into a project because you are using tools and processes that developers are already familiar with.

- Tools
      Plain text markup (Markdown).
      Developer documentation is mostly written in a lightweight markup language, such as Markdown. With a technical writing portfolio, you want to be able to share not only the rendered output, but also the source files. That way, the files can be rendered in any static site generator. More flexible than word docs that don't format properly. Markdown can be used in any 
- Workflow 
    Git version control workflow. Clone a repo, git pull, git add, commit, push
    git checkout -b documentation
    Write documentation on a separate branch, then seamlessly integrate it into the production branch. Makes it easier to coordinate new features and their documentation.
    Use GitHub.com or learn git commands


By hosting a portfolio on GitHub, you can share, learn, and interact with the developer community.
