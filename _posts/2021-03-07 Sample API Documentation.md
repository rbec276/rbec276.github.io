API documentation is my primary focus in technical writing. I have included sample documentation below. Both .yaml files are written in accordance with the Open API 3.0 specification.

1. This [documentation](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/rbec276/MovieAPI/1.0.0) describes an API that returns movie details, such as ratings, release date, genres, cast, gross earnings, etc., for a given movie title. 

2. This [documentation](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/rbec276/music-api/0.3.1-oas3) describes a mock API that allows users to create, delete, or retrieve specified music playlist(s).
