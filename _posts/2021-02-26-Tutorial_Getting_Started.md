<!-- # Getting Started -->
Twitch Studio is a desktop application for live streaming and recording videos. It's designed for people who are new to streaming and need a beginner-friendly tool to set up their first broadcasts.

## What youâ€™ll need
- Microphone
- Webcam
- A Twitch account. If you don't already have one, sign up [here](https://www.twitch.tv/signup).

## Download
Twitch Studio is available to download on both Windows and Mac. First, check that your operating system is up to date.

If installing on Windows:
- Windows 7 or newer

For Mac users:
- Mac Mojave 10.14 or newer

Then, download Twitch Studio [here](https://www.twitch.tv/broadcast/studio).

## Installation

<!-- Windows: Open the .exe file from your downloads>>Install>>Yes>>setup assistant
Mac: Open dmg>>Drag to apps>> -->

<!-- Follow the on screen prompts to set up your microphone, webcam, scenes, and stream quality settings. -->

The first time you launch the app, you'll be prompted to set up your microphone, webcam, scenes, and settings. Let's walk through this process together.

1. Click to get started.

    </p>


2. The app will detect a default microphone-- keep the default or click **Change mic** to view other options. Select the microphone you want to use and click **Continue to webcam**.

    </p>

3. If your webcam is connected, you should see it on the Webcam preview window. 

    <!-- <p align="center">

    </p> -->

    <p align="center">

    </p>

    >Note: If you were not asked to set up a webcam, Twitch Studio might not have permission to access your webcam. Skip for now and we can grant permission in the app.

4. Notice you have three custom scenes to use during your live stream. Scenes are created using graphics from Twitch Studio's media library. If you want to start exploring the media library now, click **Customize Scenes**. 


    a. In the new window, see your three scenes and a sidebar called Brand Assets. 

    b. Scroll through the sidebar to pick new colors, an accent image, wallpaper, and pattern.  

    c. Or, click the refresh logo at the top right to generate a random combination of colors and media.

    d. Click **Done**.

    You don't need to finalize your scenes just yet. They can be fully customized in the app. Click **Continue to Settings**.

    </p>

<!-- You can modify your scenes using Twitch Studio's media library. Click Customize Scenes to start exploring them now. You can also do this in the app (recommended). Click Continue to settings.
    If you want to make changes now, click the Customize Scenes button. Otherwise, continue to settings.
    Note: You can always create, edit, and customize scenes in the app. To generate new Scene graphics, click the top right [refresh logo] button next to Brand Assets. Or, scroll down to manually assign colors, an accent image, wallpaper, and pattern. Click Done. When you're ready, click continue to settings. -->

5. Evaluate stream quality settings

    Lastly, let's test your stream quality. (This might take a minute). 
    Your stream settings will be optimized based on your current setup. You shouldn't have to tweak any settings. Click Continue to App. 

    > #### Note: Streaming can be demanding on your PC. If either the bandwidth test or the hardware check are "Poor", you can still continue to the app. Just know that your stream might be choppy.
