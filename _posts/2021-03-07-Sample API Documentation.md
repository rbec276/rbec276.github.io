To view my sample API documentation, click the links below. All of my API documents are written in accordance with the Open API 3.0 specification. I also published the documents on SwaggerHub, so that you can see the .yaml source file alongside its rendered output.

1. This [document](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/rbec276/Music_API/1.0.1) describes a mock API that allows users to create, delete, or retrieve a specified music playlist(s). 
2. This [document](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/rbec276/MovieAPI/1.0.0) describes a mock API that returns movie details, such as ratings, release date, genres, cast, gross earnings, etc., for a given movie title.
