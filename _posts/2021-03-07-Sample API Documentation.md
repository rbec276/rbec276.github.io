Below are some samples of my API documentation, written in accordance with the Open API 3.0 specification. The links below take you to SwaggerHub, so that you can see the .yaml source file alongside the rendered output.

1. This [document](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/rbec276/MovieAPI/1.0.0) describes an API that returns movie details, such as ratings, release date, genres, cast, gross earnings, etc., for a given movie title. 

2. This [document](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/rbec276/Music_API/1.0.1) describes a mock API that allows users to create, delete, or retrieve specified music playlist(s).
