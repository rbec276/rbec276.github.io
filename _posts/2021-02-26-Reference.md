## Scenes sidebar

With Twitch Studio, you can customize and create new scenes. Scenes are visual themes to display throughout your stream. You'll notice that you have a Main, Just Chatting, and Be Right Back scene to start. The Main scene, for instance, might include a webcam capture, your game screen, and an alerts banner. If you need to take a break but don't want to stop streaming, customize the Be Right Back scene to pop on screen while you're away. 

In the Scenes sidebar, you'll see a list of your scenes. Right click a scene name to quickly delete, duplicate, edit, or rename it. Click the plus icon at the bottom to add a new scene.You can also select a game, window, or screen to share by clicking Change Capture.

## Stats Panel
Notice the stats panel at the top of the screen. These metrics will help you monitor stream quality and performance. Check your frame rate, upload speed, and percent load on your CPU. You can also see how many viewers are currently watching your stream and the duration of your streaming session. Click the padlock icon to change what stats display in the panel and in what order.

Click your avatar to connect with your Twitch account. You can open your Twitch dashboard/stream manager, which actually looks quite similar to the Twitch Studio interface. If you prefer recording and uploading videos to streaming, click Video Producer. Here, you can select recorded video files to upload to Twitch.

    Video producer: open Video Producer tab in Twitch (under Content) >> allows you to upload recorded video. (alternative to live streaming) -->

## Activity Feed 
The Activity Feed is where new notifications and alerts show up. Examples of notifications and alerts include new subs, follows, gifted subs, and bits. These are all actions that viewers can take to support your channel.
The difference between notifications and alerts is that notifications only show up in your Activity Feed. Alerts, on the other hand, can show up both in your Activity Feed and on your stream in the form of Twitch alerts.
Click the 3 dots icon to toggle feed notifications and alerts on or off.
