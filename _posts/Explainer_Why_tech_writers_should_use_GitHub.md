# Why should technical writers use GitHub to host their portfolio?


## Introduce yourself to the developer community

GitHub is ubiquitous to software developers; make yourself part of the community by creating a profile.

Your GitHub profile contains a bio, a showcase of your favorite projects, a heatmap of your contribution activity, and a record of your most recent updates. 

You can even include external links to a writing blog or social media. 

Once you create a GitHub profile, it's accessible to everyone. 

Show others what you've accomplished and what you want to do next.

It's not just a collection of standalone documents. 

Instead, it shows how you are actively engaging in the community. 

It's an opportunity to share what projects you've accomplished and

<!-- GitHub is a version control software. It allows multiple people to collaborate on the same files and integrate each others contributions seamlessly. 

Technical writers should be involved in the workflow that programmers use. Documentation should stay with product/project. This makes it easier for everything to stay in sync. 

Tech writers can create a new branch off the main product branch for documentation. s

Makes it easier for tech writers and developers to stay in sync. 

Tech writers can understand the workflow. 

GitHub has robust file history. Commit messages/descriptions are made every time updates are pushed to GitHub. 

Conflict resolution to make sure people aren't overwriting each other. 

Track a projects history and keep the documentation tied to the project. 

One source for everything. 

Multiple people can check out the same files and work on them simultaneously. Merging changes is when conflict resolutions are made. As long as there is good communication, you shouldn't have to resolve many conflicts.

You can search for projects that need Documentation with search tags. You can contribute to projects you find interesting. GitHub can track all the projects you contribute to, making it easier to see your presence/footprint in the tech writing/dev documentation field. 

## Grow accustomed to the developer workflow
The GitHub workflow is akin to/goes hand in hand with developer workflow. Forking a repository, pulling in updates/syncing, editing, add/commit, and push updates to GitHub. Using GitHub to host your own projects gets you accustomed to the workflow. By keeping your portfolio in GitHub repos, you can learn and practice using GitHub/developer workflow. 

## Access to Markdown source files and you can link to rendered web page. This allows people to see behind-the-scenes. 
You can also store images in your repository. All the source files are in the repo rather than your local machine. Recruiters can see your use of Markdown syntax. Can host the files on GitHub Pages. 

Can render the Markdown files in any static site generator.

Most tech writing files are in Markdown. GitHub has a markdown file editor built into the web app. You can also see the rendered markdown file in the editor. 

## Version control
Superior version control. Track file history. See the entire process instead of just the end product. GitHub is dynamic,
